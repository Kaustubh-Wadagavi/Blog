Steve Jobs was the biological son of John Jandali and Joanne Schieble. However, Schieble’s family disapproved of her relationship with Jandali, a Muslim. But, he was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs.

Steve wasn't studied well so he hasn't got any degree. But, He built the big empire named as an apple.

The Apple company born in the small garage. The Steve Jobs started doing work with his brother Steve Wozniak. Before starting the company, Their first project together called Blue Box used frequencies to make long-distance calls for free. During that time the computer revolution was being born in Silicon Valley, Wozniak saw a microprocessor for the first time. This gave him the idea for the modern computer with Keyboard, screen, and computer in one. Jobs and Wozniak labored hard to produce over a hundred computers in one month. The Apple one was profitable in 30 days. When the Apple Two was released, the success was outstanding.

After these two computers, Jobs moved onto other projects after the Apple II but was not satisfied with the Apple III or the Lisa computers. After these failures, He built "Macintosh".

The Macintosh project was originally developed by Jeff Raskin, but Jobs eventually won a power struggle, assuming full control over the project. Jobs’ perfectionism showed greatly in the Macintosh project. He wanted everything to be a beautiful interface, screens, and even inside the computer itself. Due to Macintosh computers, peoples believed that the Apple company is building technical things which are easy to access i.e. human usable. But, there was no CEO for the Apple company. Jobs believed that he was still too immature to run Apple himself, so he recruited John Sculley. John Sculley was the vice-president of the Pepsi-Cola company. Also, he is known as the one who removed Steve Jobs from Apple. John Skully removed Steve Jobs from Apple Company after completing the project, Macintosh.

When Jobs was ousted from the Apple company, He was so upset, He felt bad about he got removed from his own company. But, he didn't stop.
Jobs created the new company "NEXT". He started NEXT with his own money and hired away some of his favorite engineers from Apple, cooling relations with his first company. NEXT was designed to respond to the needs of educational institutions for computing power. "NEXT" company achieved great success.

During this success, Jobs acquired "PIXAR" company. Pixar Company is also Developed as an Apple company. Pixar is developed by Edvin Catmal. Jobs acquired a 70% stake in Lucasfilm’s animation division for $10 million and renamed it Pixar, after the name of the division’s most important piece of hardware. They Designed 3D Animated Movies of Disney named Toy story, Toy story -2 and A bug’s Life. Due to Pixar, he became a billionaire again. "NEXT" never made a dent in the computing industry because of its high cost and the small library of software. Were, Sculley was running Apple into the ground as he presided over diminishing profits and market share. So, John Skully got ousted from the Apple Company. After John Sculley, "Gil Amelio" is CEO of Apple company. Amelio needed some fresh ideas for Apple and eventually chose to acquire NEXT.

At first, it was unclear what role Jobs would have at Apple, and eventually, Amelio and Jobs settled on simply calling him an advisor.
Once back at Apple, He first stopped Newton (An Instrument) work and quietly began showing his power base by installing his favorite people from NEXT into senior Apple positions.
When it was clear that Amelio was not working well, they offered Jobs the CEO position but curiously, Jobs refused and told the adviser team to search for a new CEO. Instead, he started running Apple as the advisor, demanding the repricing of stock options for top employees, and that the entire board resigned. Jobs also managed to strike a partnership with Microsoft, which ended a decade of litigation and sent Apple’s stock price up again.

After, three months Apple's Board Selected Steve Jobs as, "the CEO of the Apple Company." Then, Jobs launched I-Pod and I-Tunes in 2002. Then, he developed I-Phones. Then, created I-Pads in 2010. Jobs resigned from the CEO position at Apple in August 2011. He appointed Tim Cook as the new CEO.

***First Thing we want to learn from Steve Jobs is if we got failure from anything then don’t think about that failure, Just think How to move on forward. (For Example, He got removed from Apple, Then he Built The “NEXT”)
Steve told that in one of his speeches that, "we should stand in front of the mirror daily and ask one question to ourselves that, Do I love what I'm doing?" If the Answer comes "NO" daily, then we have to "change our work."***
